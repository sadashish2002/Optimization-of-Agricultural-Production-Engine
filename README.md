# Optimization-of-Agricultural-Production-Engine
Project for 5th semester (Machine Learning Using Python).

This Project  is Developed by SADASHISH KUMAR BHOKTA

# Description

This Model  is an important decision support tool for crop yield prediction, it including supporting decisions on what crops to grow and what to do during the growing season of the crops. Several machine learning algorithms have been applied to support crop yield prediction research.

 Machine learning in agriculture can help in analysing large data sets and enable producers, field managers to make better decisions, improve crop performance and mitigate food safety concerns. With machine learning-based agricultural practices, making crop quality evaluations, yield estimates, disease predictions, etc becomes easier for agribusinesses.
 
In pre-harvesting machine learning is used to capture the parameters of soil, fertilizer application, humidity and environmental conditions and irrigation. Focusing on each component it is important to minimize the overall losses in production and it will helps to increase production of different Crops based on soil and climatic conditions.

Machine learning in agriculture can provide an efficient solution to this problem in the form of agribots. With machine learning empowered agribots, agribusinesses can accurately identify the right time to carry out harvesting operations. This not only enhances operational efficiency but also brings down labour costs and minimises post-harvest quality losses.

# Features:

1. What crop to grow
2. which season is best for a particular crop
3. Essential soil parameter and climatic condition
4. expanded the scale
5. speed 
6. productivity of farm equipment 
7. leading to more efficient cultivation of more land
8. Provide Statistics of the Crops

# Modules Used:
 I used  a number of python modules to work properly:

1.numpy

2.pandas

3.matplotlib

4.seaborn

5.interact

6.sklearn

7. KMean(Cluster)
   
8. train_test_split (model_selection)
   
9. logisticRegression (linear_model)
   
10. confusion_matrix (matrics)

# Installation
Install the following package by typing the following in CMD

1. pip install numpy
2. pip install pandas
3. pip install matplotlib
4. pip install seaborn 

To make sure it is installed correctly, open IDLE and execute :

-> import numpy
-> import pandas
->import matplotlib.pyplot 
->import seaborn as sns

If no errors appeared then the installation is done correctly.
